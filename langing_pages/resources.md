## What are Landing Pages? ##

In a marketing sense, __Landing Pages__ (also know as squeeze pages) are pages with a single purpose. The most general of these purposes is to either collect email addresses or funnel viewers to a registration page or shopping cart.

## Single Purpose &amp; Laser Focus ##

With landing pages, a single goal should be identified. The page layout and design should reflect that single goal.

With that in mind, an __outbound navigation should not be used__ - to your website or any other on the web. The user's attention should not be drawn from the single focus you had in mind when developing the page.

## The Two Types of Landing Pages ##

There are two basic types of landing pages you should familiarize yourself with; __[Click-Through Landing Pages](#click-through)__ and __[Lead-Generation Landing Pages](#lead-generation)__.

The function of a Click-Through landing page is to peak a users interest in a product or service before sending them to a checkout or sign-up page. The benefit is that customer acquisition rates are higher than if you sent the user straight to the checkout or sign-up page from a source such as a Pay-Per-Click ad. make sure to check out our [Click-Through Landing Page Infographic __<i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i> PDF__](#).

Lead-Generation landing pages, on the other hand, are useful for collecting user email addresses and other information. Lead-Generation landing pages are among the most useful tools in a marketers toolbox for increasing mailing lists.
